                        <p class="equipment-description">The barbell bench press is a classic exercise popular among all weight lifting circles. From bodybuilders to powerlifters, the bench press is a staple chest exercise in nearly every workout program.</p>
                        <p>For powerlifters, it is known as one of the "big three" lifts which includes the squat, deadlift, and bench press. For athletes, 1 rep max on bench press is a good indicator for on field/court performance.</p>

                        <p class="equipment-description">The deadlift is a great way to build strong legs and butt. In a deadlift, you lift the weight from the ground to thigh-level using primarily your leg and hip muscles, but with the assistance of most of the large muscle groups of your body.</p>
                        <p>The deadlift is usually performed with a bar and plates or a fixed barbell, but you can also do it with dumbbells. It is a specialty of powerlifters that you shouldn't ignore in general fitness weight training.</p>

                        <p class="equipment-description">A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.</p>
                        <p>Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.</p>
